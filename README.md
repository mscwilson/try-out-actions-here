# try-out-actions-here
This is a great project to contribute to!

some words

The latest release was version 0.1.0, a great start. Yes, v0.1.0 has a pleasing symmetry.

If this was a gem, it would be imported like this:
```ruby
# in Gemfile
gem "try-out-actions-here", "0.1.0"
```

This 0.1.0 should stay unchanged. And "v0.1.0", and this is 10.1.0. Or even 5.2.3.
